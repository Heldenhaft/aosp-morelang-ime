AOSP WiFi Keyboard
==================

This is the standard Jelly Bean 4.1 AOSP Keyboard with a few modifications:

- Merge with Ivan Volosyuk's WiFi Keyboard
- German is now QWERTY instead of QWERTZ
- Both German and Portuguese and English support the same set of international keys
(now one can type in any of these three languages in any of the keyboard layouts, even though the dictionary won't help)
- Russina Phonetic Keyboard
